### nxmgridsquares

An app that does nothing but show (currently, at most a 7x7 grid) and answer the question:

_How many squares are there in an n x m grid?_

### Why?
To try to something different in Android, to answer my uncle's question with a 3x3 grid and to understand why our guess was right.
